# What is assistive technology?

From Wikipedia: *Assistive technology (AT) is a term for assistive, adaptive, 
and rehabilitative devices for people with disabilities and the elderly. 
Disabled people often have difficulty performing activities of daily living 
(ADLs) independently, or even with assistance. ADLs are self-care activities 
that include toileting, mobility (ambulation), eating, bathing, dressing, 
grooming, and personal device care. Assistive technology can ameliorate the 
effects of disabilities that limit the ability to perform ADLs. Assistive 
technology promotes greater independence by enabling people to perform tasks 
they were formerly unable to accomplish, or had great difficulty 
accomplishing, by providing enhancements to, or changing methods of 
interacting with, the technology needed to accomplish such tasks.* You can 
read more about 
[assistive technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assistive_technology) 
and [accessibility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accessibility) from their 
respective Wikipedia articles.
